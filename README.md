## About Me
Hey there! I'm Haikal Rafif, an IS (Information System) college student with a passion for software development. I've been diving into the world of software development and tinkering with Python, C, JavaScript, and PHP for over 2 years now. I love exploring new technologies and creating web applications using JavaScript and PHP, and I'm currently expanding my skills on mobile application development by learning Flutter.

## 🌐 Web and 📱 Mobile Application Development
I have a keen interest in building both web and mobile applications. When it comes to web development, I leverage the power of JavaScript and PHP to create interactive and dynamic web experiences. I strive to deliver intuitive user interfaces and efficient back-end functionality. In the mobile realm, I'm currently honing my skills in Flutter, a versatile framework for building beautiful and performant cross-platform mobile applications.
